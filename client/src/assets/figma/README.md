## Figma exports go here

The Home page is built to match the provided Figma. To achieve **pixel-perfect visuals**, export the following from Figma and place them in this folder (keep names consistent with the components):

- Hero image
- Section images (History, Visions, Pricing, Venue cards, Catering, etc.)
- Icons (phone/mail/location, social icons)

Then update the corresponding `<img src={...}>` usages in the section components.
